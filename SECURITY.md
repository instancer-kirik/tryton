# Security Checklist for Tryton Railway Production Deployment

This document outlines security best practices and requirements for deploying Tryton on Railway for production use with DivvyQueue.

## üîí Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] **ADMIN_PASSWORD**: Set to strong password (‚â•12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- [ ] **DATABASE_URL**: Uses secure PostgreSQL connection with SSL
- [ ] **SECRET_KEY**: Set to cryptographically secure random value (‚â•32 characters)
- [ ] **SESSION_SECRET**: Set to unique random value for session encryption
- [ ] **FRONTEND_URL**: Set to your actual domain (not localhost or wildcards)
- [ ] **CORS_ORIGINS**: Restricted to your specific domains only

### Password Security
- [ ] Admin password is unique and not reused elsewhere
- [ ] Database password is strong and rotated regularly
- [ ] No default passwords are used anywhere
- [ ] Password policy enforces minimum 12 characters in Tryton config

### Database Security
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection uses SSL/TLS encryption
- [ ] Database user has minimal required privileges
- [ ] Regular automated backups are configured
- [ ] Database access is restricted to application only

### File System Security
- [ ] Configuration files have restrictive permissions (600)
- [ ] No sensitive data in environment variables that get logged
- [ ] Temporary files are cleaned up properly
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any files

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Core Security
ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourVerySecurePassword123!"
SECRET_KEY="your-cryptographically-secure-secret-key-here"
SESSION_SECRET="another-secure-random-string-for-sessions"

# Database (auto-configured by Railway PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# CORS and Access Control
FRONTEND_URL="https://your-app.railway.app"
CORS_ORIGINS="https://your-app.railway.app,https://yourdomain.com"

# Optional but recommended
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"  # Never use DEBUG in production
SESSION_TIMEOUT="3600"  # 1 hour session timeout
GUNICORN_TIMEOUT="120"  # 2 minute request timeout
```

### Forbidden Environment Variables in Production

```bash
# NEVER set these in production
DEBUG_ENABLED="true"          # ‚ùå Exposes internal information
LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"             # ‚ùå May log sensitive data
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin"        # ‚ùå Default weak password
SECRET_KEY="dev-key"          # ‚ùå Weak development key
CORS_ORIGINS="*"              # ‚ùå Allows access from any domain
```

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### User Management
- [ ] Default admin account password changed immediately

- [ ] Regular audit of user access and permissions
- [ ] Inactive accounts disabled or removed

### Session Management
- [ ] Session timeout configured appropriately (‚â§1 hour recommended)
- [ ] Secure session cookies enabled
- [ ] Session secrets rotated regularly
- [ ] Concurrent session limits if needed

### API Security
- [ ] JSON-RPC endpoints properly authenticated
- [ ] CORS configured to specific domains only
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented if needed
- [ ] API endpoints validate all input

## üåê Network Security

### HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Railway automatically provides SSL certificates
- [ ] All traffic forced to HTTPS
- [ ] Strong TLS configuration (Railway default)
- [ ] HSTS headers enabled if needed

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] CORS_ORIGINS set to specific domains
- [ ] No wildcard (*) origins in production
- [ ] Preflight requests handled correctly
- [ ] Credentials allowed only for trusted origins

### Database Connections
- [ ] Database connections use SSL/TLS
- [ ] Connection pooling configured properly
- [ ] Database network access restricted to app only

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- [ ] Authentication attempts logged
- [ ] Failed login attempts monitored
- [ ] Configuration changes logged
- [ ] Database access logged at appropriate level

### Log Security
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- [ ] Log files have appropriate permissions
- [ ] Logs rotated and archived securely
- [ ] Log monitoring and alerting configured

### Health Monitoring
- [ ] Health endpoint provides minimal information
- [ ] System metrics monitored
- [ ] Security alerts configured
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented

## üîÑ Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] **Weekly**: Review security logs for anomalies
- [ ] **Monthly**: Update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Quarterly**: Rotate secrets and passwords
- [ ] **Annually**: Full security audit and penetration testing

### Update Management
- [ ] Security patches applied promptly
- [ ] Dependencies kept up to date
- [ ] Test updates in staging before production
- [ ] Rollback plan for failed updates

### Backup Security
- [ ] Backups encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Backup restoration tested regularly
- [ ] Backup access restricted and logged
- [ ] Backup retention policy enforced

## üö® Incident Response

### Preparation
- [ ] Security incident response plan documented
- [ ] Contact information for security team updated
- [ ] Escalation procedures defined
