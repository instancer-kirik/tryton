# Railway Deployment Guide for Tryton Fork

This guide will walk you through deploying your Tryton fork to Railway for production use with DivvyQueue, with a focus on security best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Railway account (https://railway.app)
- GitHub account with your Tryton fork
- PostgreSQL database (Railway provides this)
- Domain name (optional, but recommended)
- Strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Understanding of basic security principles

## üîí Security First Approach

**IMPORTANT**: This deployment includes security improvements to prevent common vulnerabilities. Please review `SECURITY.md` for detailed security requirements.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your Tryton fork
cd /home/kirik/Code/others/tryton

# Ensure all Railway files are committed
git add railway.toml Dockerfile requirements.txt railway-trytond.conf
git add .github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Railway Project

#### Option A: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your Tryton fork repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the configuration

#### Option B: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Clone your repository if not local
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tryton.git
cd tryton

# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Link to existing project (if you created one in dashboard)
railway link
```

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database

```bash
# Via CLI
railway add postgresql

# Or in Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Go to your project
# 2. Click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables

#### Required Variables
Set these in Railway Dashboard or via CLI:

```bash
# SECURITY CRITICAL: Use strong, unique values for all variables
# Core configuration
railway variables set ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@yourcompany.com"
railway variables set ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourVerySecurePassword123!"  # 12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"      # Generate cryptographically secure key

# Session security
railway variables set SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"  # Unique session encryption key
railway variables set SESSION_TIMEOUT="3600"                       # 1 hour session timeout

# DivvyQueue integration
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL="https://your-divvyqueue-app.railway.app"
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="https://your-divvyqueue-app.railway.app"  # NO wildcards!

# Database (auto-set by Railway when you add PostgreSQL)
# DATABASE_URL is automatically configured with SSL

# Optional but recommended for production
railway variables set LOG_LEVEL="INFO"                             # Never DEBUG in production
railway variables set EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
railway variables set EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
railway variables set EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"           # Use app-specific password
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Validation
Before deployment, run the validation script:

```bash
# Validate your environment variables for security
python3 validate_env.py
```

### 5. Deploy

```bash
# Deploy via CLI
railway up

# Or push to trigger GitHub Actions
git push origin main
```

## Detailed Configuration

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Configuration

Before configuring variables, review these security requirements:

1. **Never use default or weak passwords**
2. **Generate cryptographically secure secrets**
3. **Use HTTPS-only URLs**
4. **Restrict CORS to specific domains**
5. **Keep sensitive data out of logs**

#### ‚ùå Forbidden Values in Production
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: `admin`, `password`, `123456`, `root`, `tryton`
- `SECRET_KEY`: `dev`, `development`, `secret`, `changeme`
- `LOG_LEVEL`: `DEBUG`
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: `*`, `http://localhost`

### Custom Domain Setup

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
   - Click "Custom Domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `tryton.yourcompany.com`)

2. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Add CNAME record: `tryton.yourcompany.com` ‚Üí `your-project.railway.app`
   - Wait for propagation (5-30 minutes)

3. **Update Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   railway variables set FRONTEND_URL="https://app.yourcompany.com"
   railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="https://app.yourcompany.com,https://yourcompany.com"
   ```

### SSL Certificate

Railway automatically provides SSL certificates for custom domains. No additional configuration needed.

## Database Management

### Initial Database Setup

After first deployment, initialize the database:

```bash
# Connect to Railway shell
railway shell

# The database is automatically initialized on first deployment
# If manual initialization is needed:
trytond-admin -c /app/railway-trytond.conf -d divvyqueue_prod --all

# Admin password is set via ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable
# No manual password setting needed
```

### Database Backups

#### Manual Backup
```bash
# Connect to your project
railway shell

# Create backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Download backup (if needed)
# Railway doesn't have direct file download, so use external storage
```

#### Automated Backups
Railway PostgreSQL includes automatic backups. Access them in:
1. Railway Dashboard
2. Go to your PostgreSQL service
3. Click "Backups" tab

### Database Migrations

When you update Tryton modules:

```bash
railway shell
trytond-admin -c /app/railway-trytond.conf -d divvyqueue_prod -u module_name
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### View Logs

```bash
# Via CLI - follow logs in real-time
railway logs -f

# View specific service logs
railway logs -f --service tryton

# View recent logs
railway logs --tail 100
```

### Health Checks

Your deployment includes a health endpoint:
- URL: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Returns JSON status of database and application

### Performance Monitoring

Railway provides built-in metrics:
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Check "Metrics" tab for CPU, Memory, Network usage

## Scaling and Performance

### Vertical Scaling

Railway auto-scales based on usage, but you can configure:

```bash
# Set resource limits (in railway.toml)
[deploy]
replicas = 2
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 60
```

### Database Performance

1. **Connection Pooling**: Configured in `railway-trytond.conf`
2. **Query Optimization**: Monitor slow queries in logs
3. **Indexing**: Add database indexes for frequently queried fields

### Caching

Add Redis for better performance:

```bash
# Add Redis service
railway add redis

# Redis URL will be auto-set in REDIS_URL variable
```

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to Git
- Use Railway's secret management
- Rotate passwords regularly

### Network Security
- CORS is configured for your specific domain
- HTTPS is enforced automatically
- Database is only accessible from your app

### Access Control
- Use strong admin passwords
- Implement proper user roles in Tryton
- Regular security updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --deployment latest

# Check configuration
railway variables list

# Verify requirements.txt is valid
pip install -r requirements.txt --dry-run
```

#### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Check DATABASE_URL is set
railway variables get DATABASE_URL

# Test connection
railway shell
python -c "import psycopg2; psycopg2.connect('$DATABASE_URL'); print('OK')"
```

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check application logs
railway logs -f

# Test configuration locally
python -c "from trytond.config import config; config.update_etc('railway-trytond.conf')"
```

#### Health Check Fails
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Check if database is initialized
railway shell
python -c "from trytond.pool import Pool; Pool('divvyqueue_prod')"
```

### Debug Mode

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**: Never enable debug mode in production!

For staging environment debugging only:

```bash
# Only for staging environment
railway variables set --environment staging LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"

# Production should always use:
railway variables set --environment production LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

## DivvyQueue Integration

### Update DivvyQueue Configuration

After successful deployment, update your DivvyQueue `.env`:

```env
VITE_TRYTON_URL=https://your-tryton-app.railway.app
VITE_TRYTON_DATABASE=divvyqueue_prod
VITE_TRYTON_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### Test Integration

```bash
# Test health endpoint first
curl https://your-tryton-app.railway.app/health

# Test Tryton API from DivvyQueue
curl -X POST https://your-tryton-app.railway.app/divvyqueue_prod/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"common.version","params":[],"id":1}'
```
